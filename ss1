1. Shell script to perform Arithmetic Operations
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter two numbers:"
read a b

echo "Addition: $((a + b))"
echo "Subtraction: $((a - b))"
echo "Multiplication: $((a * b))"
echo "Division: $((a / b))"
echo "Modulus: $((a % b))"
2. Shell script for Simple Interest and Compound Interest
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter Principal, Rate (per annum), and Time (in years):"
read p r t

# Simple Interest
si=$((p * r * t / 100))
echo "Simple Interest = $si"

# Compound Interest
# Using bc for decimal calculation
amount=$(echo "scale=2; $p * (1 + $r/100)^$t" | bc)
ci=$(echo "scale=2; $amount - $p" | bc)
echo "Compound Interest = $ci"
Note: bc is installed by default on Ubuntu. It's used for decimal precision.

elif [ $b -ge $a ] && [ $b -ge $c ]; then
  echo "$b is the largest"
else
  echo "$c is the largest"

  echo "$year is a Leap Year"
else
  echo "$year is not a Leap Year"

5. Shell script to convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade
bash
Copy
Edit

6. Shell script to find Area and Circumference of a Circle
bash

read r

area=$(echo "scale=2; 3.14 * $r * $r" | bc)
circumference=$(echo "scale=2; 2 * 3.14 * $r" | bc)

echo "Area = $area"
echo "Circumference = $circumference"
